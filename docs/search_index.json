[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results We have deeply understand that correlation does not repredent causal relationship. Actually, due to the existence of confounding bias, like Simponâ€™s paradox, overal data distribution can even direct to the totally opposite conclusion. We are interested in exploring the correlation behind the data and have tried to interpret them by drawing attractive and insightful graph, and we pay much attention on extracting possible causal relationship to get a better understanding and present potential suggestions to avoid crimes, and thus create a safer and relaxing community. We want to see the crime number vs category between different counties. Originally I want to combine above two but failed to merge both two functions that one is the fill part using age group and other is the order part from the top crime number to the bottom. We want to see the difference and similarity of trend between counties and discern minor discrepancy.

It can be seen that among the four boroughs of New York City, Staten Island has the least incidences of crimes in general, with the most occurred type of incidents being {}. Queens also has relatively low crime incidences. The most occurred incidences are {}. Starting from Manhattan, the number of crime incidents starts to increase. Apartment houses are the No.1 places for crimes such as {} and {} to happen. {} also takes place in Manhattan streets. Brooklyn and Bronx both have very high crime rates and almost peak out at the number of almost evrey type of crimes, wth most of them taking places in the {} and apartment {}. For most of the specific locations that a crime can take place at, the number of each type of crime is consistent with other types for most of the cases, that is, a specific location has either a generally very low (or moderate) crime rate or a generally high crime rate. For instacne, public schools, hospitals, hotels, and fast food shops all have overall very low crime rate; on the other hand, places like streets and apartment houses have the highest overall crime rate. However, there is one exception: chain stores have relative small number of crimes under all the crime categories but a very high number of crime instances under category {}.
