Especially with the most recent tragic loss on Davide Giri, a graduate student at Columbia that was killed in a violent attack, we feel deeply sad and concerned with the New York crime situation. To understand the crimes better, we selected the crime dataset from NYPD government website Considering the large amount of data, we filtered the most recent 3 years (2018-2020) to further investigate. The follwing question are discussed in our analysis out of our curiosity: 1. In recent 3 years, what is the type of crime and number of crime distribution? Where are the crime most likely to take place? 2. Is there any hidden relationship between suspect and victim profile? Does crime tends to happend in specific age/gender/race group? 3. When does crime more likely to happen in different region - is there a tendency that more crime happens at night? In our report, we analyze the above problem with different types of graphs including bar plots line graphs, paralell coordinate charts, alluvial flow diagram etc. We utilize package such as ‘dplyr’and ’ggplot’ in R in creating our plots. We also use D3 to create the interactive component in order to present a more visually powerful result. This is a interactive map that contains the total number of crime in NYC in each borough region from 2018-2020. We collect the borough boundaries data from NYC open data website. When hover the mouse to the region, the page will show the number of crime counts in that region. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Data source of this project is from [NYPD Complaint Data Historic] Provided by Police Department (NYPD) Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i?ref=hackernoon.com The dataset has more than 7M rows and each row represents one complaint related to a crime event. One complaint contains information related to the accident time, reported time, the event position, the characteristics of victim and suspect. According to the exact date of occurrence for the reported event, the year ranges from 1950 to 2020. We mainly focuses on 2018-2020 data, since it can better represent the most recent trend. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation After some exploratory analysis and reading the description of the dataset on the website, we decide to add several of variable based on our current data. Firstly, we think there might be some interesting relationship in the crime report time frame. That is, how long between a crime happen and the person to report. We would like to explore how different crime type influence on the time gap result. So we added the date gap variable. Secondly, we split the date variable into year, month and date for easier analysis. Also, when generating the graph, we created variable such as summation of the value and average of the value in the subset. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Column pattern", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Column pattern After implementing our self-defined missing value plot function here, the plot is shown as below. According the plot, we found that variables below have a large ratio of missing values. We put the basic descriptions in corresponding variables: PARKS_NM: Name of NYC park, playground or greenspace of occurrence, if applicable (state parks are not included). HADEVELOPT: Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable. HOUSING_PSA: Development Level Code. TRANSIT_DISTRICT: Transit district in which the offense occurred. STATION_NAME: Transit station name The descriptions show that it makes senses that the former 3 variables have missing values since they are all possibly applicable variables, which means that when being designed, it is presumed that there might be no values here. As the latter two variables, the logic is similar that not every crime event happens near a transit station. Left missing variables include: SUSP_AGE_GROUP, SUSP_RACE, SUSP_SEX, LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC, COMPLNT_TO_DT, COMPLNT_TO_TM They can still be used in our analysis since the proportion is small. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Visualization about portraits of suspects and victims. 5.2 Visualization about daily crime trend.", " Chapter 5 Results We have deeply understand that correlation does not represent causal relationship. Actually, due to the existence of confounding bias and selection bias, overal data distribution can even direct to the totally opposite conclusion. We are interested in exploring the correlation behind the data and have tried to interpret them by drawing attractive and insightful graph, and we pay much attention on extracting possible causal relationship to get a better understanding and present potential suggestions to avoid crimes, and thus create a safer and relaxing community. The incidences of harrassment are outstandingly high among all the types of crimes, with that of assult and petite larceny being the next highest. All of these three types of crimes are not severe and are still being a big part of social problems now in 2021. Another group that is outstanding is the 25-44 age group, with the largest number of victims among all the age groups. In addition, it can also be easily seen that Staten Island has the lowest incidents among all types of crimes. Next take a look at the possible change of the number of different types of the crimes and see if there would present a certain trend. While no remarkable contrast between the number of crimes among the three years, some minor differences can still be perceived. In 2020, the number of crimes slightly decreases compared to the former two years, especially for larceny, harrassment and assult. This has shown that various orgnizations, institutions, and the government have indeed taken effective actions aiming to solve these issues and this graph has shown that there has been positive progresses. Combine the crime types with locations together with corresponding boroughs to see correlations among the dataset. The above parallel coordinates chart displays the number of crime incidences of the top 20 crime types, grouped by specific locations each crime incidence took place and the borough where each incident occurred. It can be seen that among the four boroughs of New York City, Staten Island has the least incidences of crimes in general, with the most occurred type of incidents being intoxicated and impaired driving. Queens also has relatively low crime incidences. The most occurred incidences are grand larceny of motor vehicle. Starting from Manhattan, the number of crime incidents starts to increase. Apartment houses are the No.1 places for crimes such as theft-fraud and grand larceny to happen. Grand larceny also takes place in Manhattan streets. Brooklyn and Bronx both have very high crime rates and almost peak out at the number of almost evrey type of crimes, wth most of them taking places in the streets and apartment houses. For most of the specific locations that a crime can take place at, the number of each type of crime is consistent with other types for most of the cases, that is, a specific location has either a generally very low (or moderate) crime rate or a generally high crime rate. For instacne, public schools, hospitals, hotels, and fast food shops all have overall very low crime rate; on the other hand, places like streets and apartment houses have the highest overall crime rate. However, there is one exception: chain stores have relative small number of crimes under all the crime categories but very high instances of petite larceny. 5.1 Visualization about portraits of suspects and victims. We want to see the portrait of suspects and victims of all crimes in recent three years. By an alluvium, we focus on the victim sex, denoted by different colors, as well as the other information related to one crime event. From the graph above, we can have a direct understanding that crimes in NYC happen on women more than men and as for the suspect number, the number of male suspect is 3 times as women. In addition, it is not hard to see that in male and female suspects, their targets both focus more on women. Certainly there is no gender opposition in crimes, but we do see women is always the vulnerable group. STOP WOMEN VIOLENCE! More help and guard shoule be paid on women. We have understood that there is a specific age structure in the whole population and we do not gather related information, but we do see that in NYC, compared between victim and suspects, old people aged from 45 to 64 is more vulnerable. 5.2 Visualization about daily crime trend. In this graph, we see the daily trend of crime number in five counties. The y axis is the crime number, the x axis is the hour in a day. The fill part is the victim sex. Since the population and areas of five counties are unknown, we free the y axis and only focus on the daily trend. And we do find a very similar trend in these five counties. The daily valley appears at 5-7 o’clock while the daily peak appeas at 15-19 o’clock. (We exclude the 12 o’clock peak since we regard it as the auto fill of missing value and it does not meet the daily trend) Besides, we add victim sex in the graph to show more solicitude for sex discrepancy. Unfortunately, we see that in all these five counties, in daily time, women are more vulnerable than men. However, at night, from appr. 22 o’clock to 5 o’clock, men are as much vulnerable as women. In staten island this conclusion is not obvious while in other four counties, the crime numbers of men and women are nearly the same.

We can observe that the wordCloud graph shows the typical description of a crime type. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusion 8.1 Limitation of this analysis 8.2 Future directions 8.3 Lesson learned", " Chapter 8 Conclusion We derive several conclusions that are not known to people based on the data analysis of crimes in recent years in NYC: At night, men and women are equally vulnerable to crimes. Crimes happened most at dusk time and least at dawn time. Women are victims of both women and men. STOP WOMEN VIOLENCE. 8.1 Limitation of this analysis There are two types of limitations of our analysis: We do not get related data of population age structure, and the population distribution along the five counties. We do see the number difference between ages, sex and race, but we do not know the actual proportion and cannot judge the likelihood. 8.2 Future directions 8.3 Lesson learned We found that data visualization should service our conclusions, which means that once we get a conclusion from the prior data visualization, we should be pay more attention on how to draw a graph, even simple, unattractive, to support and highlight our observation and conclusion. But unfortunately, we pay more attention on how to draw a fancy, complex and high-dimensional graph, which might include a lot of information and dimension, might be fancy. So when it comes to draw our prior conclusion, our complex, fancy graphs fail to show the difference clearly enough. And this contradicts to the rule that data visualization should service our conclusions. But one advantage might be that, complex and high-dimensional graph is space saving and do attract people to find their own insight! :) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
