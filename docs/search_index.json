Actually, due to the existence of confounding bias, like Simponâ€™s paradox, overal data distribution can even direct to the totally opposite conclusion. We are interested in exploring the correlation behind the data and have tried to interpret them by drawing attractive and insightful graph, and we pay much attention on extracting possible causal relationship to get a better understanding and present potential suggestions to avoid crimes, and thus create a safer and relaxing community. 5.1 Data Visualization about portraits of suspects and victims. We want to see the portrait of suspects and victims of all crimes. We pay much attention on the victim sex, as well as the other information relatex to one crime event. STOP WOMEN VIOLENCE! We want to see the crime number vs category between different counties. Originally I want to combine above two but failed to merge both two functions that one is the fill part using age group and other is the order part from the top crime number to the bottom.
