<p>Link: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i?ref=hackernoon.com" class="uri">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i?ref=hackernoon.com</a></p>
<p>The dataset has more than 7M rows and each row represents one complaint related to a crime event.</p>
<p>One complaint contains information related to the accident time, reported time, the event position, the characteristics of victim and suspect. According to the exact date of occurrence for the reported event, the year ranges from 1950 to 2020. We mainly focuses on 2018-2020 data, since it can better represent the most recent trend.</p>

<p>We have deeply understand that correlation does not repredent causal relationship. Actually, due to the existence of confounding bias, like Simponâ€™s paradox, overal data distribution can even direct to the totally opposite conclusion. We are interested in exploring the correlation behind the data and have tried to interpret them by drawing attractive and insightful graph, and we pay much attention on extracting possible causal relationship to get a better understanding and present potential suggestions to avoid crimes, and thus create a safer and relaxing community.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Data Visualization about portraits of suspects and victims.</h2>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1920" />
We want to see the portrait of suspects and victims of all crimes. We pay much attention on the victim sex, as well as the other information relatex to one crime event.</p>
<p>STOP WOMEN VIOLENCE!</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="1920" /></p>
<p>We want to see the crime number vs category between different counties.</p>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1920" /></p>
<p>Originally I want to combine above two but failed to merge both two functions that one is the fill part using age group and other is the order part from the top crime number to the bottom.</p>

<p>The above parallel coordinates chart displays the number of crime incidences of the top 20 crime types, grouped by specific locations each crime incidence took place and the borough where each incident occurred.</p>
<p>It can be seen that among the four boroughs of New York City, Staten Island has the least incidences of crimes in general, with the most occurred type of incidents being {}.
Queens also has relatively low crime incidences. The most occurred incidences are {}.
Starting from Manhattan, the number of crime incidents starts to increase. Apartment houses are the No.1 places for crimes such as {} and {} to happen. {} also takes place in Manhattan streets.
Brooklyn and Bronx both have very high crime rates and almost peak out at the number of almost evrey type of crimes, wth most of them taking places in the {} and apartment {}.</p>
<p>For most of the specific locations that a crime can take place at, the number of each type of crime is consistent with other types for most of the cases, that is, a specific location has either a generally very low (or moderate) crime rate or a generally high crime rate. For instacne, public schools, hospitals, hotels, and fast food shops all have overall very low crime rate; on the other hand, places like streets and apartment houses have the highest overall crime rate. However, there is one exception: chain stores have relative small number of crimes under all the crime categories but a very high number of crime instances under category {}.</p>
