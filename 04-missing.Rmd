# Missing values
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Column pattern
Variables below have a large percentage of missing values:

- PARKS_NM: Name of NYC park, playground or greenspace of occurrence, if applicable (state parks are not included).
- HADEVELOPT: Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable.
- HOUSING_PSA: Development Level Code.
- TRANSIT_DISTRICT: Transit district in which the offense occurred.
- STATION_NAME: Transit station name

Hence it makes senses that the former 3 variables have missing values since not they are all possibly applicable variables, which means that when designing the columns, it is presumed that they might be null values.
